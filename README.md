# Inventory Management System for a Retail Store

## Project Overview

The **Inventory Management System (IMS)** is a command-line application designed to manage products in an inventory efficiently. This system allows users to perform basic inventory operations such as:

- Adding new products (name, price, stock, category)
- Updating product stock or price
- Viewing all products in a tabular format
- Generating a list of low-stock items based on a threshold

This system is ideal for small retail stores to track and manage their inventory effectively.
